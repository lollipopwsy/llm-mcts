New plan: In this environment, my initial plan was to locate the cutleryfork and the wineglass and place them on the kitchentable. However, I repeatedly walked to the kitchencounterdrawer without actually grabbing the items or moving to the kitchentable. To improve, I will start by walking to the kitchencounterdrawer, grab the cutleryfork, and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place it down. Next, I will return to the kitchencounterdrawer, grab the wineglass, and again walk directly to the kitchentable to place it down, ensuring that I complete each step efficiently and without unnecessary repetition.

New plan: In this environment, my goal was to place a cutleryfork and a wineglass on the kitchentable. However, I spent too much time walking back and forth to the kitchencounterdrawer without actually grabbing the items needed. In the next trial, I will start by going directly to the kitchencounterdrawer, grab the cutleryfork, and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place it. Then, I will go to the appropriate location for the wineglass, likely the kitchencounter or a cupboard, grab the wineglass, and place it on the kitchentable, ensuring I do not waste time with unnecessary movements.
