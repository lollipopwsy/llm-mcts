New plan: In this environment, my goal was to put a wineglass and a plate on the kitchentable. However, I made the mistake of repeatedly walking to the kitchencounterdrawer without actually grabbing the items needed. In the next trial, I will start by going to the kitchencounterdrawer, grab the wineglass, and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place it. Then, I will return to the kitchencounterdrawer or another likely location for the plate, grab it, and place it on the kitchentable as well, ensuring I do not waste time with unnecessary movements.

New plan: In this environment, my goal is to place a wineglass and a plate on the kitchentable. My initial approach involved wandering around and repeatedly accessing the kitchencounterdrawer, which led to no progress. In the next trial, I will start by going directly to the kitchencounter where the wineglass and plate are likely located. Once I find the wineglass, I will grab it and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place it there. After that, I will return to the kitchencounter, find the plate, grab it, and place it on the kitchentable as well, ensuring I do not get distracted by other objects or locations.
Simulation 3 Reflection:

New plan: In this environment, my goal is to put one wineglass and one plate on the kitchentable. However, I spent too much time wandering around the kitchencounterdrawer without actually grabbing the items needed. In the next trial, I will start by going directly to the kitchencounter where the wineglass and plate are located, grab the wineglass first, and immediately place it on the kitchentable. Then, I will return to the kitchencounter, grab the plate, and place it on the kitchentable as well, ensuring that I do not get distracted by unnecessary movements or interactions.
Simulation 4 Reflection:
reflection:
New plan: In this environment, my goal is to put one wineglass and one plate on the kitchentable. However, I spent too much time wandering around the kitchencounterdrawers without actually grabbing the items needed. In the next trial, I will start by going directly to the area where the wineglasses are typically stored, grab a wineglass, and immediately place it on the kitchentable. Then, I will proceed to the area where plates are stored, grab a plate, and place it on the kitchentable as well, ensuring that I do not get distracted by other objects or areas.
Simulation 5 Reflection:
reflection:
New plan: In this environment, my goal is to put a wineglass and a plate on the kitchentable. My previous attempts involved aimlessly walking to the kitchencounterdrawer multiple times without actually grabbing the items needed. To improve, I will start by going directly to the area where the wineglass is located, grab it, and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place it. Next, I will locate the plate, grab it, and again walk directly to the kitchentable to place it there. This approach ensures that I focus on the specific items needed and minimize unnecessary movements.
Simulation 7 Reflection:
reflection:
New plan: In this environment, my initial approach was to navigate around the kitchen area, specifically focusing on the kitchencounterdrawer, but I failed to actually locate and grab the wineglass and plate, and I did not make it to the kitchentable to place them. In the next trial, I will start by going directly to the kitchencounter where the items are likely to be found. Once at the kitchencounter, I will carefully search for the wineglass, grab it, and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place it. After that, I will return to the kitchencounter, find the plate, grab it, and place it on the kitchentable as well, ensuring that I do not get distracted or repeat unnecessary movements.
Simulation 8 Reflection:
reflection:
New plan: In this environment, my initial approach involved repeatedly walking to the kitchencounterdrawer, which did not contain the wineglass or plate, leading to failure. To successfully complete the task, I will start by going to the kitchen area where these items are more likely to be found. First, I will walk to the cupboard or another likely storage location to find the wineglass, grab it, and then walk directly to the kitchentable to place it there. Next, I will return to the kitchen area to find the plate, ensuring I check the appropriate storage locations such as the cupboard or kitchencounter, grab the plate, and then walk to the kitchentable to place it alongside the wineglass. This direct and methodical approach will help avoid the previous mistake of repeatedly checking the wrong locations.

New plan: In this environment, my initial approach was to search for the wineglass and plate by repeatedly walking to the kitchencounterdrawer, but I failed to actually grab and place the items. In the next trial, I will start by going to the kitchencounter where the wineglass is likely located, grab the wineglass, and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place it. Then, I will return to the kitchencounter or another likely location for the plate, grab the plate, and place it on the kitchentable as well, ensuring I complete each step without unnecessary repetition.
Simulation 10 Reflection:
reflection:
New plan: In this environment, my initial approach was to navigate towards the kitchencounterdrawer repeatedly, which led to a failure in completing the task. I did not actually pick up the wineglass or the plate, nor did I move to the kitchentable to place them. In the next attempt, I will start by walking to the kitchencounterdrawer, but this time, I will ensure to grab the wineglass and then proceed to the kitchentable to place it. After successfully placing the wineglass, I will return to the kitchencounterdrawer, grab the plate, and then walk to the kitchentable to place the plate as well, ensuring that both items are placed on the kitchentable without unnecessary movements.

New plan: In this environment, my goal is to put a wineglass and a plate on the kitchentable. My previous attempts involved repeatedly walking to the kitchencounterdrawer without actually grabbing the items needed. To improve, I will start by going directly to the kitchencounter where the wineglass and plate are likely located, grab the wineglass, and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place it down. Next, I will return to the kitchencounter, grab the plate, and again walk to the kitchentable to place it down, ensuring I do not get distracted by other drawers or objects.
Simulation 12 Reflection:

New plan: In this environment, my initial approach was to navigate to the kitchencounterdrawer repeatedly, but I failed to actually retrieve the wineglass or the plate and place them on the kitchentable. In the next trial, I will start by walking directly to the kitchencounterdrawer, open it, and grab the wineglass. Then, I will walk to the kitchentable and place the wineglass there. Next, I will return to the kitchencounterdrawer, open it again, and grab the plate. Finally, I will walk to the kitchentable and place the plate alongside the wineglass, ensuring that both items are on the kitchentable as required.
