New plan: In this environment, my goal is to place a cutleryfork and a wineglass on the kitchentable. However, I repeatedly placed both items on the kitchencounter instead of the kitchentable, which led to the failure of the task. To correct this, I will start by walking directly to the cutleryfork, grabbing it, and immediately walking to the kitchentable to place the cutleryfork there. Next, I will walk to the wineglass, grab it, and again walk directly to the kitchentable to place the wineglass there. By ensuring that each item is placed directly on the kitchentable after grabbing it, I will avoid the mistake of placing them on the kitchencounter.
