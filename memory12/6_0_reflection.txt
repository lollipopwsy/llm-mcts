New plan: In this environment, my goal is to put one plate and one wineglass on the kitchentable. My previous attempts involved repeatedly walking to the kitchencounterdrawer without actually grabbing the items needed. To improve, I will start by going directly to the kitchencounterdrawer, grab a plate, and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place the plate. Next, I will return to the kitchencounterdrawer, grab a wineglass, and again walk to the kitchentable to place the wineglass, ensuring that I do not get distracted or repeat unnecessary movements.
