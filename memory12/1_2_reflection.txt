New plan: In this environment, my initial plan was to find the cutleryfork and place it on the kitchentable, followed by finding the plate and placing it on the kitchentable. However, I repeatedly picked up the cutleryfork and placed it on the kitchencounter instead of the kitchentable, which led to the failure of the task. To avoid this mistake in the future, I will focus on picking up the cutleryfork from its location, walking directly to the kitchentable, and placing it there before moving on to find the plate. Once the cutleryfork is successfully placed on the kitchentable, I will locate the plate, pick it up, and place it on the kitchentable as well, ensuring that all items are placed in the correct location without unnecessary detours or incorrect placements.

New plan: In this environment, my goal was to place one cutleryfork and one plate on the kitchentable. However, I repeatedly walked back and forth between the cutleryfork and the kitchentable without actually placing the items on the table. In the next trial, I will start by going to the cutleryfork, grabbing it, and immediately walking to the kitchentable to place the cutleryfork. Then, I will go to the plate, grab it, and walk directly to the kitchentable to place the plate, ensuring that I do not leave the items in my hands until they are properly placed on the kitchentable.
