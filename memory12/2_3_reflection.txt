New plan: In this environment, my goal was to place a cutleryfork and a wineglass on the kitchentable. However, I repeatedly placed the items on the kitchencounter instead of the kitchentable, which led to the failure of the task. In the next trial, I will start by going directly to the cutleryfork, grabbing it, and immediately walking to the kitchentable to place the cutleryfork there. Then, I will go to the wineglass, grab it, and walk directly to the kitchentable to place the wineglass alongside the cutleryfork, ensuring that both items are placed on the kitchentable without any detours or incorrect placements.

New plan: In this environment, my initial plan was to place a cutleryfork and a wineglass on the kitchentable, but I repeatedly failed to place the cutleryfork on the kitchentable, instead putting it back on the kitchencounter. To correct this, I will start by going directly to the cutleryfork, grabbing it, and immediately walking to the kitchentable to place it there. After successfully placing the cutleryfork, I will then locate the wineglass, grab it, and walk to the kitchentable to place it alongside the cutleryfork, ensuring that I do not make the same mistake of putting items back on the kitchencounter.
