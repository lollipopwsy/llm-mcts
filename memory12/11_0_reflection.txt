New plan: In this environment, my goal was to place a cutleryfork and a plate on the kitchentable. However, I repeatedly grabbed the cutleryfork and placed it on the kitchencounter instead of the kitchentable. To avoid this mistake in the next trial, I will first locate the cutleryfork, grab it, and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place it there. After successfully placing the cutleryfork, I will then locate the plate, grab it, and walk directly to the kitchentable to place the plate alongside the cutleryfork, ensuring that both items are placed on the kitchentable as required.
