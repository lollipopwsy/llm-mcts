New plan: In this environment, my initial approach was to find items in the kitchencabinet, but I repeatedly grabbed the dishwashing liquid instead of the wineglass and cutleryfork, which led to failure. In the next trial, I will start by going to the kitchencabinet, carefully identifying the wineglass and cutleryfork, grabbing each item, and placing them directly on the kitchentable without any unnecessary actions or detours. If the items are not in the kitchencabinet, I will check other likely locations such as the kitchencounter or dining table before attempting to place them.

New plan: In this environment, my goal was to place a wineglass and a cutleryfork on the kitchentable. However, I ended up grabbing dishwashing liquid instead of the required items and did not proceed to actually place them on the kitchentable. In the next trial, I will start by going directly to the kitchencabinet, carefully checking for the wineglass and cutleryfork. Once I find the wineglass, I will grab it and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place it there. Then, I will return to the kitchencabinet or kitchencounterdrawer to find the cutleryfork, grab it, and place it on the kitchentable as well, ensuring I do not grab any other items that are not part of the task.

New plan: In this environment, my goal was to place a wineglass and a cutleryfork on the kitchentable. However, I made the mistake of repeatedly walking to the kitchencabinet and grabbing the dishwashing liquid instead of the required items. In the next trial, I will start by going directly to the kitchencabinet, carefully identifying and grabbing the wineglass, then walking to the kitchentable to place it. After that, I will return to the kitchencabinet, identify and grab the cutleryfork, and place it on the kitchentable as well, ensuring I focus on the correct items and avoid unnecessary actions.

New plan: In this environment, my goal was to put a wineglass and a cutleryfork on the kitchentable. However, I made several mistakes by repeatedly walking to the kitchencabinet and grabbing the dishwashing liquid instead of the required items. In the next trial, I will start by going to the kitchencabinet, opening it, and carefully selecting the wineglass. Once I have the wineglass, I will walk directly to the kitchentable and place it there. Next, I will return to the kitchencabinet, open it again, and this time select the cutleryfork. After grabbing the cutleryfork, I will walk to the kitchentable and place it alongside the wineglass, ensuring that both items are on the kitchentable as required.

New plan: In this environment, my goal was to place a wineglass and a cutleryfork on the kitchentable, but I ended up repeatedly walking to the kitchencabinet and grabbing a dishwashing liquid instead of the required items. In the next trial, I will start by going directly to the kitchencabinet, opening it, and carefully selecting the wineglass. After grabbing the wineglass, I will walk straight to the kitchentable and place it there. Next, I will return to the kitchencabinet, open it again, and this time select the cutleryfork. I will then walk to the kitchentable and place the cutleryfork alongside the wineglass, ensuring I do not grab any other items that are not part of the task.

New plan: In this environment, my goal was to place a wineglass and a cutleryfork on the kitchentable, but I repeatedly walked to the kitchencabinet without actually grabbing either item, leading to failure. In the next trial, I will start by going to the kitchencabinet, specifically identifying and grabbing the wineglass, then walking directly to the kitchentable to place it there. Afterward, I will return to the kitchencabinet, identify and grab the cutleryfork, and again walk directly to the kitchentable to place it alongside the wineglass, ensuring I do not get distracted or repeat unnecessary movements.
