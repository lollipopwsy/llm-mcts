New plan: In this environment, my goal was to place a cutleryfork and a wineglass on the kitchentable. However, I repeatedly placed both items on the kitchencounter instead of the kitchentable, leading to failure. In the next trial, I will start by going directly to the cutleryfork, grab it, and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place it there. Then, I will go to the wineglass, grab it, and again walk directly to the kitchentable to place it there, ensuring that both items are placed on the kitchentable as required.
