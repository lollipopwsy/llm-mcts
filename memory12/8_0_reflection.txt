New plan: In this environment, my goal was to place a wineglass and a cutleryfork on the kitchentable. However, I repeatedly walked to the kitchencounterdrawer without actually grabbing the items needed or moving to the kitchentable. In the next trial, I will start by going directly to the location where the wineglass is, likely the cupboard or another drawer, grab the wineglass, and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place it. Then, I will go to the location where the cutleryfork is, likely the kitchencounterdrawer or another storage area, grab the cutleryfork, and again walk directly to the kitchentable to place it, ensuring that I do not get distracted or repeat unnecessary movements.

New plan: In this environment, my goal was to place a wineglass and a cutleryfork on the kitchentable. However, I repeatedly navigated to the kitchencounterdrawer without actually grabbing either item and failed to move towards the kitchentable. In the next trial, I will start by going to the kitchencounter where the wineglass is located, grab it, and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place the wineglass. Then, I will go to the kitchencounterdrawer, grab the cutleryfork, and walk directly to the kitchentable to place the cutleryfork, ensuring that I do not get distracted by unnecessary movements or interactions.
Simulation 3 Reflection:

New plan: In this environment, my goal is to place a wineglass and a cutleryfork on the kitchentable. My previous attempts involved excessive wandering around the kitchencounterdrawer without actually grabbing the items needed. In the next trial, I will start by going directly to the kitchencounter where the wineglass is located, grab it, and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place the wineglass. Then, I will return to the kitchencounterdrawer, find the cutleryfork, and bring it to the kitchentable to complete the task efficiently.
Simulation 4 Reflection:
reflection:
New plan: In this environment, my initial approach was to find the wineglass and cutleryfork from the kitchencounterdrawer and place them on the kitchentable. However, I became stuck repeatedly walking to the kitchencounterdrawer without actually grabbing the items or moving to the kitchentable. To improve, I will start by going directly to the kitchencounterdrawer, ensuring I grab the wineglass first, then walk to the kitchentable and place it there. Next, I will return to the kitchencounterdrawer, grab the cutleryfork, and place it on the kitchentable, avoiding any unnecessary loops or detours.
Simulation 5 Reflection:
reflection:
New plan: In this environment, my initial approach involved repeatedly walking to the kitchencounterdrawer, which led to a failure in completing the task. I did not actually grab the wineglass or the cutleryfork, nor did I move to the kitchentable to place them. In the next trial, I will start by going to the kitchencounterdrawer, grabbing the wineglass, and immediately walking to the kitchentable to place it there. Then, I will return to the kitchencounterdrawer, grab the cutleryfork, and walk to the kitchentable to place it as well, ensuring each step is purposeful and directly contributes to achieving the goal.
Simulation 6 Reflection:
reflection:
New plan: In this environment, my initial approach was to navigate around the kitchen area, specifically focusing on the kitchencounterdrawer, but I failed to actually grab the wineglass and cutleryfork and place them on the kitchentable. In the next trial, I will start by walking directly to the kitchencounter where the wineglass is located, grab it, and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place it down. Then, I will return to the kitchencounter, locate the cutleryfork, grab it, and walk to the kitchentable to place it down as well, ensuring that I complete each step efficiently and without unnecessary movements.
Simulation 7 Reflection:
reflection:
New plan: In this environment, my goal is to put a wineglass and a cutleryfork on the kitchentable. My previous attempts involved repeatedly walking to the kitchencounterdrawer, which did not contain the required items. In the next trial, I will start by exploring the kitchen more thoroughly to locate the wineglass and cutleryfork. Once I find the wineglass, I will immediately take it to the kitchentable and place it there. Then, I will search for the cutleryfork, likely in a drawer or on a counter, and once found, I will bring it to the kitchentable and place it alongside the wineglass, ensuring both items are correctly positioned without unnecessary movements.

New plan: In this environment, my goal is to place a wineglass and a cutleryfork on the kitchentable. My previous attempts involved repeatedly walking to the kitchencounterdrawer, which did not contain the required items. In the next trial, I will start by exploring different areas of the kitchen to locate the wineglass and cutleryfork. Once I find the wineglass, I will take it directly to the kitchentable and place it there. Then, I will search for the cutleryfork, likely in a drawer or on another counter, and bring it to the kitchentable as well, ensuring that I do not get distracted by unnecessary movements or interactions.
Simulation 9 Reflection:
reflection:
New plan: In this environment, my goal is to place a wineglass and a cutleryfork on the kitchentable. However, I spent too much time wandering around the kitchencounterdrawer without actually grabbing the items needed. In the next trial, I will start by walking directly to the kitchencounter where the wineglasses are located, grab a wineglass, and immediately place it on the kitchentable. Then, I will walk to the drawer or area where the cutleryfork is stored, grab it, and place it on the kitchentable as well, ensuring I do not get distracted by unnecessary movements or repeated visits to the same location.

Simulation 11 Reflection:
reflection:
New plan: In this environment, my initial strategy involved wandering around the kitchen and repeatedly accessing the kitchencounterdrawer, which led to a failure in completing the task. I did not actually pick up the wineglass or the cutleryfork and place them on the kitchentable. In the next trial, I will start by going directly to the kitchencounter where the wineglass is located, grab the wineglass, and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place it there. Then, I will return to the kitchencounterdrawer to find the cutleryfork, grab it, and place it on the kitchentable as well, ensuring that each step is purposeful and directly contributes to achieving the goal.
