Task 0, Step 11, Simulation 72
Goal: put 1 bottle on the kitchentable, put 1 bowl on the kitchentable.

False
New plan:In this environment, my plan was to find a bottle, then place it on the kitchentable, followed by finding a bowl and placing it there as well. However, I kept mistakenly putting the bottle back on the kitchencounter instead of placing it on the kitchentable, which caused me to fail the task. I should have placed the bottle directly on the kitchentable after finding it. In the next trial, I will go directly to the kitchentable, place the bottle there, then find the bowl and place it on the kitchentable as well.


Task 10, Step 7, Simulation 15
Goal: put one cutleryfork on the kitchentable, put one apple to the fridge.
Complete trajectory:
[walk] <kitchen> (32)
[walk] <cutleryknife> (105)
[grab] <cutleryknife> (105)
[walk] <kitchentable> (72)
[putback] <cutleryknife> (105) <kitchentable> (72)
[walk] <apple> (85)
[grab] <apple> (85)
[walk] <fridge> (56)
[open] <fridge> (56)
[putback] <apple> (85) <fridge1> (56)
[walk] <cutleryfork> (368)
[grab] <cutleryfork> (368)
[putback] <cutleryfork> (368) <kitchentable> (72)
False
New plan: In this environment, my plan was to place the cutleryfork on the kitchentable and the apple in the fridge. However, I mistakenly grabbed the cutleryknife instead of the fork, and I also did not place the correct item back in the right location. In the next trial, I will correctly grab the cutleryfork first and place it on the kitchentable, then grab the apple and put it in the fridge without any unnecessary actions.


Task 13, Step 6, Simulation 14
Goal: put one apple inside the fridge.
Complete trajectory:
[walk] <livingroom> (50)
[walk] <coffeetable> (75)
[walk] <bedroom> (90)
[walk] <nightstand> (60)
[walk] <kitchen> (40)
[walk] <kitchencabinet> (110)
[open] <kitchencabinet> (110)
[walk] <kitchencabinet> (110)
[walk] <kitchen> (40)
[walk] <kitchencabinet> (110)
[open] <kitchencabinet> (110)
[walk] <kitchencabinet> (110)
[walk] <kitchentable> (95)
[walk] <apple> (135)
[grab] <apple> (135)
False
New plan: In this environment, my goal was to put the apple inside the fridge, but I repeatedly walked to the wrong locations and mispredicted the apple is on the nightstand in the bedroom and on the coffee table in the living room. In the next trial, I will go directly to the kitchentable, grab the apple, and place it inside the fridge without unnecessary detours or actions.
