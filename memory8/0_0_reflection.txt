New plan: In this environment, my goal was to place one cutleryfork and one plate on the kitchentable. However, I repeatedly grabbed the cutleryfork and placed it on the kitchencounter instead of the kitchentable, and I did not even attempt to find and place the plate. In the next trial, I will first go directly to the cutleryfork, grab it, and immediately place it on the kitchentable. Then, I will locate the plate, grab it, and place it on the kitchentable as well, ensuring that both items are placed correctly without any unnecessary actions or detours.
