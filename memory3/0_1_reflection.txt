It seems I repeatedly failed to place the cutlery fork on the kitchen table, instead putting it back on the kitchencounter. This indicates a failure to correctly execute the final step of placing the fork on the intended destination.

**Plan:**
1. Walk to the cutlery fork location.
2. Grab the cutlery fork.
3. Walk directly to the kitchen table.
4. Place the cutlery fork on the kitchen table.
5. Confirm the placement by checking the state of the kitchen table.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for the plate, ensuring it is also placed on the kitchen table.

By ensuring that I walk directly to the kitchen table after grabbing the fork and confirming its placement, I can avoid the mistake of putting it back on the kitchencounter. The same approach will be applied for the plate.
