New plan: In this environment, my goal was to place a cutleryfork and a plate on the kitchentable. However, I repeatedly placed the cutleryfork on the kitchencounter instead of the kitchentable, which led to the failure of the task. In the next trial, I will start by going directly to the cutleryfork, grabbing it, and immediately walking to the kitchentable to place it there. After ensuring the cutleryfork is on the kitchentable, I will proceed to the plate, grab it, and walk directly to the kitchentable to place it there as well, avoiding any detours or incorrect placements.
