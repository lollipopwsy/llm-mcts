New plan: In this environment, my goal was to place a cutleryfork and a plate on the kitchentable. However, I repeatedly walked to the kitchencounterdrawer without actually grabbing the items needed. In the next trial, I will start by going directly to the kitchencounterdrawer, grab the cutleryfork, and immediately walk to the kitchentable to place it there. Then, I will return to the kitchencounterdrawer or another likely location for the plate, grab the plate, and place it on the kitchentable as well, ensuring I do not waste time with unnecessary movements.

Simulation 7 Reflection:
reflection:
New plan: In this environment, my goal was to place a cutleryfork and a plate on the kitchentable. However, I became stuck repeatedly walking to the kitchencounterdrawer without actually grabbing the items or moving towards the kitchentable. To improve, I will start by going to the kitchencounterdrawer, grab the cutleryfork, then walk directly to the kitchentable and place the cutleryfork there.
