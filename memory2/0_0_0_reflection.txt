Few-shot reflection:
It seems I repeatedly failed to place the cutlery fork on the kitchen table, instead putting it back on the kitchencounter. The issue appears to be in the sequence of actions where I kept returning to the cutlery fork location without actually placing it on the kitchen table.

**Plan:**
1. Walk to the cutlery fork location.
2. Grab the cutlery fork.
3. Walk directly to the kitchen table.
4. Place the cutlery fork on the kitchen table.
5. Walk to the plate location.
6. Grab the plate.
7. Walk directly to the kitchen table.
8. Place the plate on the kitchen table.
